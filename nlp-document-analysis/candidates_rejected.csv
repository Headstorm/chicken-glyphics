From Daniel:
""have not been contacted yet about scheduling another interview. Will did send me the same challenge that you had sent when we first contacted but I looked it over and the challenge along with the phone interview has led me to worry that I might not be a good fit for Headstorm. This seems to be a very software based company and when I saw that the challenge revolved around programming a webpage and database, that just isn't really in my realm of expertise. I tried to be upfront about this in the phone interview. If I am wrong, I'd be happy to have an in-person interview, but from what I've learned about Headstorm I just wouldn't want to waste anyone's time if I'm not a good fit. I'm always happy to learn but this is very different than what I've been learning in school.

Sent Eva the following email:

Thank you so much for taking the time to talk with them team and I. I want to thank you so much for coming in to meet our team here. After collaborating with all of your interviewers, we have decided not to move forward with you in the interview process. That is as a Senior Consultant.

I want to also give you feedback behind the exact reason why we came to this decision. First off you looked sharp, so thumbs up on that! Our team thought you were a great culture fit. Overall your interviewers felt you were smart. 

The major concern came due to your lack of exposure to different technologies and overall how you performed throughout all of your technical interviews. The consulting world at Headstorm is very fast paced and with some more solid practice on some programming concepts on the Database and back end side of things, we feel you can get there in the future. Your front end experience was great though. 

Unfortunately, we can’t consider you for a Senior Consultant role but if you are willing (less compensation up front) we can discuss the Consultant role with you. 

Thank you so much for taking the time to apply and interview with us here at Headstorm. I really hope this feedback will benefit you in the future.

Regardless if you do want to discuss the Consultant position or not, best of luck to you on your job search!

I am attaching our Career Path and our Benefits to look over for you if a C2 Position would be something you would consider let me know.

If it’s not what you want compensation wise, no worries I understand that completely! 

Again, thank you so much for your time. It was a pleasure meeting you!",10/11/2019,09/30/2019,,"Addison, Pittsburgh",Delivery,Gianna Figueroa,,09/10/2019,,,10/11/2019,30600730002,34365872002,4060378002,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hi Keith,

Thank you so much for your application to Headstorm your resume and skill set are quite impressive, but may align perfectly for the type of candidates we look for. We also may not perfectly align for what you are looking for either.

To give you more insights on the type of candidates we look for at Headstorm:

 Full stack engineer or the capability to be one
 Comfortable being Tech agnostic (Willing to work on more than one technology stack)
 Able to communicate thought process well
 Collaborates well on our team 
 Client facing
I would love for you to complete the Headstorm challenge. There are three separate challenges - a front end, database and back end challenge. Once you are able to complete all three challenges and have submitted them, let me know and I will have our consultants take a look at it. It is not a timed assessment and was built internal on our team. Ideally candidates should have it completed within one to two weeks. 

https://www.headstorm.com/challenge
 
Once you have the chance to complete this challenge I would love to schedule you for a phone call with myself and talk to you about the rest of our process and Headstorm

Thank you for your time and application!

Best,
Gianna Figueroa

Hi Gianna,

I want to first and foremost thank the Headstorm team for taking the time out of their busy schedules to meet with me. I am very impressed by the company and its employees. It sounds like a fun place to work! Regrettably, I will be unable to continue the interview process for the Dallas position, since for personal reasons I need to be located in the northeast US region / New York area. I apologize for not being able to give earlier notice. 

If Headstorm has positions available in the New York region, I would be thrilled to pursue the opportunity. Please let me know if any such opportunities exist.

Thank you again for your time and consideration,

Challen's notes:

His lack of experience is pretty stark. For our purposes, he would be pretty much entry level. He has a little bit of experience right out of college, but it’s been almost three years since then. I think he’ll have to learn any frontend frameworks or back end frameworks from scratch.
He did the challenge in PHP and JQuery, neither of which likely to ever use.
Asking him about his resume was like pulling teeth. He did a really bad job of selling his experience, and wasn’t really willing to go into depth about either of his previous jobs.
He didn’t really seem to like either of his jobs, but it also didn’t really seem like he was putting in the work to get where he wanted to be at those jobs.
Back to the question of his experience, considering the fact that he has been unemployed since November, I would expect him to be learning some other tools/frameworks/languages that he wants to use, instead of only bringing PHP to the table.
That combined with the rest of his interview, I didn’t get the impression he was all that passionate, or even interested in software development.
The positives are that he did a good job with the algorithmic and coding questions we had for him.
He had a solid grasp of the fundamentals of coding and was able to work through the algorithm question with a little bit of assistance (which is to be expected).
He didn’t blow me away with his communication of his thought process, but it wasn’t bad.
And his Objective section on his resume was a pretty bad first impression.",4/17/2019,04/17/2019,,"Addison, Pittsburgh",Delivery,Brandy Collins,Brandy Collins,03/28/2019,,,04/17/2019,18674765002,20788109002,4057668002,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
